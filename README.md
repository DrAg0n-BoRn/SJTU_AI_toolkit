# Interpretable AI Toolkit to Visualize Latent Features from Electron Microscope Images

## Abstract

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Microscale imaging analysis represents a significant area of research in the materials characterization field; consequently, it requires computational methods able to match the remarkable quality of modern imagery techniques. We introduce Visual-CCC, a novel AI toolkit approach that provides precise visualization of latent features in imagery samples at a microscale level. Our approach leverages digital image processing algorithms supplemented by a supervised deep neural network and a class activation mapping technique. Furthermore, we implemented unsupervised machine learning to complement the toolkitâ€™s visualizations. Taking imagery data of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) as a case study, we achieved a weighted accuracy of 93.8% in its morphology determination. In order to validate the generalization of the toolkit implementation, samples of microscale imagery of alloy substance were used to test the available modules. To package and distribute the toolkit, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) has been released. The results are satisfactory and position the toolkit to make significant contributions to microscale imaging research in the fields of material characterization and electron microscopy.
