# Interpretable AI Toolkit to Visualize Latent Features from Electron Microscope Images

## Abstract

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Microscale imaging analysis requires computational methods that match the remarkable quality of modern imagery. Here, we introduce a novel approach that provides precise analysis and visualization of latent features in sample microscale imagery of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). We implemented this approach using a combination of contemporary artificial intelligence techniques as well as well-established computational algorithms. Our approach leverages some digital image processing algorithms supplemented by supervised machine learning algorithms. The classification model yielded a weighted accuracy of 93.8%, afterwards a class activation mapping technique was implemented to better understand the reasoning behind this classification process and provide further insights on the imagery data itself. To complement the visualizations, digital image processing algorithms were included into the toolkit.  Furthermore, we explored unsupervised machine learning using a k-means clustering algorithm due to its well-known applications in visualization. In order to validate any future expansion and generalization of the current toolkit implementation, different algorithms used were tested using samples of microscale imagery of alloy substances. To package and distribute the toolkit, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented. The resulting image visualizations are satisfactory and position the toolkit to make significant contributions to microscale imaging research in the field of material characterization and electron microscopy. The trained model serves as a commencing point for further research using artificial intelligence techniques such as transfer learning for a wide gamma of research and applications using microscale imagery. The implications of this work are far-reaching, offering a streamlined and efficient tool for researchers in the field.
