# Morphological Analysis of Microscale Images Using a Hybrid Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing Framework

## Abstract

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Microscale imaging analysis is an indispensable technique for the investigation of chemical composition, structure, morphology, micro-interface, and formation and evolution processes in the fields of battery materials, alloys and other materials. However, the intricate formation mechanism and structure, the vast and intractable reaction network and noise interference lead to a pressing need for efficient and specialized supporting image processing technology to extract key information of the materials. Here, we propose "Visualization through Classification, Class Activation Mapping and Clustering at a microscale level" (Visual-CCC), a machine learning-based microscale image analysis framework that provides precise latent feature extraction and visualization. Visual-CCC leverages digital image processing algorithms supplemented by a supervised deep neural network, class activation mapping technique, and unsupervised learning algorithm, which provides a real-time and dynamic visualization method for identifying hidden patterns through a simple graphical user interface. As a case study, we applied the proposed Visual-CCC model to analyze cryogenic transmission images of lithium deposition morphologies in lithium metal batteries. The model achieved accurate classification between dendritic and spherical lithium deposits, with a weighted accuracy of up to 93.8%. Furthermore, through heatmap visualization, image segmentation, and clustering tools, the framework allows in-depth parsing and analysis of critical characteristics in material morphology images. The results promise Visual-CCC to make significant contributions to material characterization, electron microscopy, and other physical-related fields.
