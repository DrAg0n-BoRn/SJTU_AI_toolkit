# Microscale imaging analysis of interphase and surface morphologies based on multi-component machine learning algorithms

## Abstract

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Microscale imaging analysis is an indispensable technique for the investigation of chemical composition, structure, morphology, micro-interface, and formation and evolution processes in the fields of battery materials, alloys and other materials. Techniques derived from electron microscopy provide high-resolution images of materials. However, the intricate formation mechanism and structure, the vast and intractable reaction network and noise interference lead to the lack of efficient and specialized supporting image processing technology to extract key information of the materials. Here, we propose "Visualization through Classification, Class Activation Mapping and Clustering at a microscale level" (Visual-CCC), a machine learning-based microscale image analysis framework that provides precise latent feature extraction and visualization. Visual-CCC leverages digital image processing algorithms supplemented by a supervised neural network, class activation mapping technique and unsupervised learning algorithm, which provides a real-time and dynamic visualization method for identifying hidden patterns. As case studies, the proposed Visual-CCC achieved a weighted accuracy as high as 93.8% and 89.0% in morphology determination of solid electrolyte interphase and alloy substance, respectively. The results promise Visual-CCC to make significant contributions to material characterization, electron microscopy, and other physical-related fields.
