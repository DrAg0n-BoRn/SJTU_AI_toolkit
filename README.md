# Morphological Analysis of Microscale Images Using a Hybrid Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing Framework

## Abstract

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Microscale imaging analysis is an indispensable technique for the investigation of chemical composition, structure, morphology, micro-interface, and formation and evolution processes in the fields of battery materials, alloys and other materials. However, extracting key information from these images is challenging due to material complexity, intricate microstructures, and signal noise, necessitating advanced image processing technologies. Here, we propose Visual-CCC ('Visualization through Classification, Class Activation Mapping and Clustering at a microscale level'), a machine learning framework for precise feature extraction and visualization. Visual-CCC integrates supervised deep learning, class activation mapping, and unsupervised clustering to reveal hidden material patterns through an interactive graphical user interface. As a case study, we applied the proposed Visual-CCC model to analyze cryogenic transmission images of lithium deposition morphologies in lithium metal batteries. The model achieved accurate classification between dendritic and spherical lithium deposits, with a weighted accuracy of up to 93.8%. Furthermore, through heatmap visualization, image segmentation, and clustering tools, the framework allows in-depth parsing and analysis of critical characteristics in material morphology images. These results position Visual-CCC as a powerful tool for advancing material characterization, electron microscopy, and related physical sciences.
